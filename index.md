### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab7 has only one part but it proved to be both the most challenging and rewarding for me. It stands out as a pivotal experience because it demanded deep reflection and careful tracing back of my codes due to encountering numerous logic errors. This particular lab prompted me to dive into the complex of "if and else statements", compelling me to develop concrete reasoning behind their implementation. Overall, it was a valuable moment to pateintly seat down on the screen that significantly contributed to my understanding and problem-solving skills in programming.

* Lab 9
    Lab 9, part 2 was my second pick as I found it thoroughly enjoyable and engaging. It brought back memories of a similar assignment we had done in the course, where we implemented a guessing game without utilizing file operations like ifstream, ofstream, and fstream. However, this time around, we were asked with a more complex idea to create this game by handling ifstream and ofstream functionalities effectively. This lab provided an excellent opportunity of file manipulation.

* Lab 11
    Lab 11, part 1 would be my third pick as I was able to refresh my memory about Object-Oriented Programming also known as OOP to many people. Through the implementation of the State class and various member functions, I was able to reinforce my understanding of the concept and their practical applications. Working with classes allowed me to organize and encapsulate data and functionality, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
